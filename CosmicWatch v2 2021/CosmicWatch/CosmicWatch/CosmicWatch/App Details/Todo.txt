Priorities:
	1. UWP: Dispose/reconnect delay issue.
		The issue is that the first loadAsync is slow. There does not appear to be any other way around this.

	2. Clean up the app, start extracting things into variables meant to be modified by the config file, and comment it.

	3. Minimally functional options page.
		a. This likely involves integration and usage of the C# Configurations class/library.
		b. Before I do this, I need an idea of what options are required.
			i. Colours(?)
			ii. Languages(?)
			iii. Inside/Outside selector

	4. Implement different recording types. Ex. repeated recordings over X period of time.

	5. Conclude project/round 1. Publish app?

Time input as time picker or preset intervals
Explaination, background information, and/or construction page. Possibly an embedded youtube video?

Dedicated preset options.

Code Refactor and Upgrade.
	Currently have something funky going on with close. Should look into IDispose instead. May run into errors.
	TWO data records - one for raw, the other for processed.

Bing Maps API integration to get reverse geocoding for the UWP side of this app: Figure it out.
	==> Promoting this problem to the status of undead demon. I spent 3 hrs trying to figure this BS out! It won't work!

Graphing Library Integration - 80% completed
	Consider plugin: https://github.com/datavisyn/chartjs-plugin-error-bars

Options:
	Save/No save
	Simulate with a fake device?

Data comparison - One set of data against the other.
	==> Need verification that we're comparing like against like!
