Priorities:
	1. UWP: Dispose/reconnect delay issue.
	2. Clean up the app, start extracting things into variables meant to be modified by the config file, and comment it.
	2a. More meaninful CSV save files.
	3. Minimally functional options page.
		a. This likely involves integration and usage of the C# Configurations class/library.
	4. Implement different recording types. Ex. repeated recordings over X period of time.
	5. Conclude project/round 1. Publish app?

Time input as time picker or preset intervals
Explaination, background information, and/or construction page. Possibly an embedded youtube video?
Options:
	Colour (for the colourblind especially)
	Languages
Inside/outside selector?
Dedicated preset options.

Altimiter maybe? Hardware end of things. Not my area of expertise here.

Code Refactor and Upgrade.
	Currently have something funky going on with close. Should look into IDispose instead. May run into errors.
	More serious:
		Architecture issues between multiple things keeping track of when a recording has or hasn't begun.
			Possiblility: Rather than a boolean variable keeping track, most things use a boolean action/function; they query one switch. Still, honestly this sucks.
				Observer/event based programming, duh silly.
					Centralize what to do when recording ends function calls in MainPageModel, probably.
					Also centralize the stopwatch and TWO data records - one for raw, the other for processed.
		Issue with new recordings needing to start a new connection to not have a stupid backlog of data.
		Problem is: I want to flush the input buffer of a serial device. It's not really letting me :// No obvious way.

Bing Maps API integration to get reverse geocoding for the UWP side of this app: Figure it out.
	==> Promoting this problem to the status of undead demon. I spent 3 hrs trying to figure this BS out! It won't work!

Graphing Library Integration - 80% completed
	Consider plugin: https://github.com/datavisyn/chartjs-plugin-error-bars

Options:
	Save/No save
	Simulate with a fake device?

Data comparison - One set of data against the other.
	==> Need verification that we're comparing like against like!
